# FinalProject_AnomalyPrediction

This repository contains the source code for implementing Anomaly Prediction in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data using models like ARIMA, SARIMA and LSTM.

The datasets utilized are of the Gujarat coastal region (available in this repo) and the Korean Peninsula.

The Korean peninsula dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y4QjUElDZDWlZSrrupoFhlEl1CbPcuK5/view?usp=sharing)
